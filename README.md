# HSF-ChemBO-tutorial

A tutorial on quick adoption of our proposed dimension-aware hyperprior for hidden-space representations in chemical Bayesian optimization.
The environment is based on [BayBE 0.12.2](https://emdgroup.github.io/baybe/0.12.2/).

For all the code and data used in the paper **Leveraging Hidden-Space Representations Effectively in Bayesian Optimization for Experiment Design through Dimension-Aware Hyperpriors**, see another [repo](xxx).
